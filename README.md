### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Patrick, pat for friends and hys on the net :). 
# I'm currently studying Computer Science at University of Bologna (UniBo) as an undergraduate. I'm quite interested in learning stuff about software, developing applications with different prog. languages, but i don't really like hardware-related things, that's really not my preference :') . Here you'll find some projects that I did / i'm doing for various Uni courses and, less often (due to lack of time sigh), personal applications.
